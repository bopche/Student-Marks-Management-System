Student Marks Management System — Python Mini Project
Hi there! 
This is a simple, beginner-friendly Python project I built while learning about object-oriented programming, loops, input validation, and file handling. The idea was to create a basic console-based system to manage student marks and practice core Python concepts in the process.

What it Does:
This program allows you to:

Add new students (with name, roll number, and a list of marks)
Search for a student by their roll number
Update student marks
Display all student information along with their average
Save all data to a file (saves.txt)
Exit the system gracefully

All of this happens through a user-friendly menu, with clear messages and input validation to make sure things don’t break unexpectedly. It even handles cases like entering a name with numbers or typing marks in the wrong format.

What I Learned:
Classes and objects in Python (OOP)

Validating user input using try-except and loops

Using lists and list comprehension

Writing to and reading from files

Building simple CLI menus using loops and conditions
